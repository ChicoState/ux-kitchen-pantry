## Caveats

The paywall is the biggest limitation in these apps. These types of apps will provide a very small amount of features, or no features, you can access without paying. You have to sign into each account separately to use the shopping feature and most times it crashes. Because of the paywall, we could not access many parts of the apps to learn more about the bugs or other possible issues.
