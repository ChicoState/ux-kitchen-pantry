# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve !!!

## Methods

During our research, we used multiple research methods such as downloading applications similar to ours, reading reviews of the application, testing the application, and trying to find any software errors or bugs. By doing this, we collected data that would help us improve our application and make our application stand out from the rest of them.



## Findings

Downloading applications, Describe: 
- While downloading similar applications we found that most of the applications were targeting, users who are on a diet, Fitness users, and users who are willing to learn how to cook simple meals. 

---Reading reviews of the application, Describe:---
- Multiple users were complaining about how limited features were available until they paid for a subscription that allowed them to use the completed version of the application.
- Users complain about how many bugs need to be fixed and how slow the application gets
- Error in scanning barcodes 
- Linking Store to certain applications
---Testing the application, Describe:---
- The user interface works wonderfully, 
- The application looks modern for today's standards
- Certain applications have built-in shortcuts 
- Certain applications didn’t allow you to realm freely until you finished the tutorial or paid a subscription.  
- Makes it simple to shop for ingredient
- Gives you recommendations of certain foods and recipe
- Certain application makes you answer a few questions to find what kind of food you like

---Software errors or bugs, Describe:---
- Certain applications will crash 
- Certain applications will lag.
- Exit the tutorial option
       -Certain applications won’t let you do anything without finishing the tutorial first 
- Linking external shopping accounts will sometimes make the application crash or duplicate orders. 


## Conclusions

Users are looking for a free or cheaper app that keeps track of their pantry items and can help them find recipes. They would like something that accesses all their needs for grocery shopping while also not making it more difficult by being signed out of their accounts all the time. A recommendation would be to get rid of the ability to make orders from stores from the app; it should allow a user to make a list, but the accounts are where the issues are so removing it would not allow that problem to be made. Keep a familiar layout so a user can assume how it works without much thought. For example, keep a bar on the bottom where to go or create a menu section. 

## Caveats

The paywall is the biggest limitation in these apps. These types of apps will provide a very small amount of features, or no features, you can access without paying. You have to sign into each account separately to use the shopping feature and most times it crashes. Because of the paywall, we could not access many parts of the apps to learn more about the bugs or other possible issues.
