# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

Users are looking for a free or cheaper app that keeps track of their pantry items and can help them find recipes. They would like something that accesses all their needs for grocery shopping while also not making it more difficult by being signed out of their accounts all the time. A recommendation would be to get rid of the ability to make orders from stores from the app; it should allow a user to make a list, but the accounts are where the issues are so removing it would not allow that problem to be made. Keep a familiar layout so a user can assume how it works without much thought. For example, keep a bar on the bottom where to go or create a menu section. 

## Caveats

The paywall is the biggest limitation in these apps. These types of apps will provide a very small amount of features, or no features, you can access without paying. You have to sign into each account separately to use the shopping feature and most times it crashes. Because of the paywall, we could not access many parts of the apps to learn more about the bugs or other possible issues.
