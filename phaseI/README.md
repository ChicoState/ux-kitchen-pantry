# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Our project tackles the prevalent issue of deciding what to cook with the ingredients available at home, addressing the challenges faced by individuals with diverse lifestyles and hoping to minimize food waste.

This initial phase concentrates on understanding users through personas, evaluating competitors like Supercook, and initiating design concepts. By delving into these aspects, we aim to lay the foundation for a user-centric meal planning application that revolutionizes kitchen interactions and addresses the identified challenges.

Our project in Phase I addresses the universal challenge of deciding what to cook with the ingredients at home, catering to many different lifestyles. We aim to streamline the meal preparation experience by understanding users through personas, evaluating competitors like Supercook, and initiating design concepts. This phase sets the stage for a user-centric meal planning application that transforms kitchen interactions, providing an efficient solution for creating delicious meals with available ingredients.

## Methods

During our research, we conducted multiple research methods, including downloading applications similar to ours, reading reviews left by the user from our competitor's application, testing their functionalities, and identifying any software errors or bugs. 

As we conducted our competitive analysis, our team was divided to investigate both the Google Play Store and the App Store, as these were the two main application stores from which potential users would download. While performing this analysis, we documented strengths, weaknesses, quality levels, and costs. Then, we selected the top five competitors that we would be facing

After selecting the five applications, as a group, we started to look into the reviews of each application to find existing problems and any potential bugs we might face. We commenced testing the application to generate ideas and identify any problems. By doing this, we collected data that would help us improve our application and make us stand out from the rest of the other competitors.

## Conclusions

Users are looking for a free or cheaper app that keeps track of their pantry items and can help them find recipes. They would like something that accesses all their needs for grocery shopping while also not making it more difficult by being signed out of their accounts all the time. A recommendation would be to get rid of the ability to make orders from stores from the app; it should allow a user to make a list, but the accounts are where the issues are so removing it would not allow that problem to be made. Keep a familiar layout so a user can assume how it works without much thought. For example, keep a bar on the bottom where to go or create a menu section. 

## Caveats

The paywall is the biggest limitation in these apps. These types of apps will provide a very small amount of features, or no features, you can access without paying. You have to sign into each account separately to use the shopping feature and most times it crashes. Because of the paywall, we could not access many parts of the apps to learn more about the bugs or other possible issues.
