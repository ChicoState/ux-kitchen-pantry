Reduce his carbon footprint and waste less
Save money by cooking more
Learn about more cultures


## Scenario: Anthony’s Empty Fridge
After a day of teaching the youth, Anthony would like to start his new goal of cooking more. He is looking into his fridge and sees some random ingredients and is stumped on where to start. He grabs a pan and just puts together random ingredients to make something before his food expires. He does not love the meal he made, but it is a start.

Part-time worker at a retail store and full time student

Itzel is a busy person with a full schedule. She just got a new puppy and has no time to explore her new celiac disease diagnosis. She struggles to cook every day and sees herself going to Chipotle often since it’s one of her only gluten-free options that is quick. She barely has any time to cook and learn what is and is not celiac-safe.

  - Learn how to cook gluten-free

## Scenario: Itzel’s quick meal
Itzel has a huge test tomorrow but has no money to go out to eat. She wants to use what is in her kitchen but is bored with her usual meals. She has barely any time to think about what to make so she is rushed and makes a meal she does not want to eat. She is frustrated with her new diet once again.
