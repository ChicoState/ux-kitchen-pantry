# Scenarios
Scenario: Anthonyâ€™s Empty Fridge
After a day of teaching the youth, Anthony would like to start his new goal of cooking more. He is looking into his fridge and sees some random ingredients and is stumped on where to start. He grabs a pan and just puts together random ingredients to make something before his food expires. He does not love the meal he made, but it is a start.
