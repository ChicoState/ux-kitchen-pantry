# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In Phase III of our project, we transitioned from refining interactions and designing wireframes to conducting user testing with participants and finalizing the wireframes. Our focus remained on enhancing the user experience of the Kitchen Pantry meal planning app. We created a protocol and consent form for the participants in our usability tests. Additionally, we prioritized completing the wireframes to ensure intuitive navigation and interaction within the application.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

The user testing we conducted in Phase III offered valuable insights, but we faced some caveats. Due to resource constraints, we had only a few participants and a short testing period, which may have limited our ability to capture diverse user perspectives and thoroughly explore all usability issues. The participants are coming from usability backgrounds so the way the users navigated through the tests may not have been entirely as a person with no background would have navigated.
