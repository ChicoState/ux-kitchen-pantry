# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

During our research, we conducted cross-team communication, we allowed other teams to review our wireframes and documents of each character. Based on this research we were able to examine three types of scenarios from our listening character. This allows our wireframe design to be tested and identify any software errors or bugs.
## Findings

After our cross-team communications were done, We collected multiple types of data from the wireframe design to users' experiences. Our first issue was two bugs. (“Bugs is a term for ongoing issues within the software or applications”). These issues were that users weren’t able to add ingredients to the pantry and save recipes to the applications. 

Our second finding was that users wanted us to add a “Quick Meal” section where the application would suggest quick and easy meals to prepare for busy users. Another finding that we were not aware of was the navigation system in place for the application. Some users were confused about how to navigate through the menus. To fix this we are going to redesign the navigation system. Besides this, the cross-team communication methods also help us gain some user experience.

        <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough of Marcos Ortega</h3>
        Marcos is a hard-working employee at a Warehouse who works 12-hour shifts, four days a week. He enjoys working out and being fit, he enjoys cooking healthy meals for his family. He wants to become better at cooking for his family.<br>
        When Marco first goes onto the app his main goal is to learn how to be a better cook, so he wants to find a new recipe and use ingredients he already has to improve at cooking. At the home screen he first selects recipes to find a recipe to make. He then would click the search recipes button. He will then look at some recipes and click view details to see the ingredients. He wishes there was a way he could save the recipe, but looking at the ingredients is enough for now. He wants to add ingredients to the pantry page, but he can’t find it anywhere. He then goes to the shopping list page after making a paper list of the ingredients he already has. He clicks the add item and adds the details of each ingredient that he is missing on the shopping list page. He knows there is a meal planning page, but he can’t seem to navigate to it in any way. Frustrated, he goes to the store. He wishes he could have added the ingredients he already has and added the recipe to a meal plan. He goes to the store to get ingredients because at least he got a new recipe to try.
