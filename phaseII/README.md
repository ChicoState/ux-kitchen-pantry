# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Continuing our journey to refine Kitchen Pantry meal planning application's user experience.
Developing detailed wireframes for intuitive navigation and interaction.
Using cross-team communication to validate design decisions and gather insights.
Testing and refining wireframes based on user feedback.
Prioritizing user-centric design principles for enhanced usability.
Collaborating closely with the development team to ensure alignment with project goals.

## Methods

During our research, we conducted cross-team communication, we allowed other teams to review our wireframes and documents of each character. Based on this research we were able to examine three types of scenarios from our listening character. This allows our wireframe design to be tested and identify any software errors or bugs.
## Findings

After our cross-team communications were done, We collected multiple types of data from the wireframe design to users' experiences. Our first issue was two bugs. (“Bugs is a term for ongoing issues within the software or applications”). These issues were that users weren’t able to add ingredients to the pantry and save recipes to the applications. 

Our second finding was that users wanted us to add a “Quick Meal” section where the application would suggest quick and easy meals to prepare for busy users. Another finding that we were not aware of was the navigation system in place for the application. Some users were confused about how to navigate through the menus. To fix this we are going to redesign the navigation system. Besides this, the cross-team communication methods also help us gain some user experience.

        <h3><u>Cognitive Walkthrough of Marcos Ortega</u></h3>
        Marcos is a hard-working employee at a Warehouse who works 12-hour shifts, four days a week. He enjoys working out and being fit, he enjoys cooking healthy meals for his family. He wants to become better at cooking for his family.<br>
        When Marco first goes onto the app his main goal is to learn how to be a better cook, so he wants to find a new recipe and use ingredients he already has to improve at cooking. At the home screen he first selects recipes to find a recipe to make. He then would click the search recipes button. He will then look at some recipes and click view details to see the ingredients. He wishes there was a way he could save the recipe, but looking at the ingredients is enough for now. He wants to add ingredients to the pantry page, but he can’t find it anywhere. He then goes to the shopping list page after making a paper list of the ingredients he already has. He clicks the add item and adds the details of each ingredient that he is missing on the shopping list page. He knows there is a meal planning page, but he can’t seem to navigate to it in any way. Frustrated, he goes to the store. He wishes he could have added the ingredients he already has and added the recipe to a meal plan. He goes to the store to get ingredients because at least he got a new recipe to try.

        <h3><u>Cognitive Walkthrough of Itzel</u></h3>
        <b>First step:</b>
          <ul>Make a recipe given the ingredients she has at home. She doesn’t have much time to go out and buy ingredients so she has to work with what she has at home.</ul>
        <br>
        <b>Second step:</b>
           <ul>She will need to add her ingredients into the pantry section.</ul>
        <br>
        <b>Third step:</b>
           <ul>After adding her ingredients, recipes will pop up that utilize the ingredients she already has at home. Given her busy schedule, she does not have time to add many recipes to her meal plan. She looks through the recipes page to find a meal that is gluten free but also quick to make.</ul>
        <br>
        <b>Results</b>
        <ul>At this point, the user will know what to do next. Either the user will add ingredients to her shopping list for future meals and also add meals to her meal plan for future use. In this scenario though, Itzel does not have much time and only wanted to make a quick meal.</ul>

        <h3><u>Cognitive Walkthrough of Anthony</u></h3>
        I am is trying to cook more to save money but doesn’t really have much experience or know where to start. He has some ingredients in the house but is not sure what to use them in.
        <br><br>
        At the homepage, he would click on the pantry button to start adding all the ingredients he has available to cook with. He can add the name of the item, the amount, and the expiration date.
        <br><br>
        <ul>Will the user know what to do at this step?</ul>
        <br>
        <ul><ul>Yes, it is mostly clear that Anthony should be adding his ingredients to figure out what he can make with what he has.</ul></ul>
        <br><br>
        <ul>If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?</ul>
        <br>
        <ul><ul>Yes, the ingredients will show up as a list in his ‘pantry’.</ul></ul>
        <br><br>
        After this, Anthony can move to the recipes tab to see recipes that he can make, and other ones that he would need additional ingredients for. He can expand the recipes to see more details and he can also search more specifically for recipes.
        <br><br>
        <ul>Will the user know what to do at this step?</ul>
        <br>
        <ul><ul>Yes. After clicking on the recipes tab from the homepage, they are displayed in front of Anthony with additional search options.</ul></ul>
        <br><br>
        <ul>If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?</ul>
        <br>
        <ul><ul>Yes, Anthony would be able to see recipes, see how to cook them, and see the ingredients they require.</ul></ul>
        <br><br>
        Finally, Anthony would move to the shopping list, where he would add all the ingredients he doesn’t have for the recipes he wants to make.
        <br><br>
        <ul>Will the user know what to do at this step?</ul>
        <br>
        <ul><ul>Yes. He can make a list, add items, and mark them as purchased after he buys them. Additionally, the page shows the quantity he needs, as well as the price and store he can buy them from.</ul></ul>
        <br><br>
        <ul>If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?</ul>
        <br>
        <ul><ul>Yes. The ingredients Anthony needs to purchase are laid out as a list that is easy to understand.</ul></ul>

As you can see, we had multiple types of feedback such as adding a Quick Meal section and fixing a big issue with our navigation system. Since we didn’t add a direct link to the meal plan page, and save recipes. Now we are planning to update our navigation system for the application and conduct more experiments to improve, and make the application user-friendly.
