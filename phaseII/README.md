# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

During our research, we conducted cross-team communication, we allowed other teams to review our wireframes and documents of each character. Based on this research we were able to examine three types of scenarios from our listening character. This allows our wireframe design to be tested and identify any software errors or bugs.
## Findings

After our cross-team communications were done, We collected multiple types of data from the wireframe design to users' experiences. Our first issue was two bugs. (“Bugs is a term for ongoing issues within the software or applications”). These issues were that users weren’t able to add ingredients to the pantry and save recipes to the applications. 

Our second finding was that users wanted us to add a “Quick Meal” section where the application would suggest quick and easy meals to prepare for busy users. Another finding that we were not aware of was the navigation system in place for the application. Some users were confused about how to navigate through the menus. To fix this we are going to redesign the navigation system. Besides this, the cross-team communication methods also help us gain some user experience.

        <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough of Marcos Ortega</h3>
        Marcos is a hard-working employee at a Warehouse who works 12-hour shifts, four days a week. He enjoys working out and being fit, he enjoys cooking healthy meals for his family. He wants to become better at cooking for his family.<br>
        When Marco first goes onto the app his main goal is to learn how to be a better cook, so he wants to find a new recipe and use ingredients he already has to improve at cooking. At the home screen he first selects recipes to find a recipe to make. He then would click the search recipes button. He will then look at some recipes and click view details to see the ingredients. He wishes there was a way he could save the recipe, but looking at the ingredients is enough for now. He wants to add ingredients to the pantry page, but he can’t find it anywhere. He then goes to the shopping list page after making a paper list of the ingredients he already has. He clicks the add item and adds the details of each ingredient that he is missing on the shopping list page. He knows there is a meal planning page, but he can’t seem to navigate to it in any way. Frustrated, he goes to the store. He wishes he could have added the ingredients he already has and added the recipe to a meal plan. He goes to the store to get ingredients because at least he got a new recipe to try.

        <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough of Itzel</h3>
        <b>First step:</b>
        <br>
          Make a recipe given the ingredients she has at home. She doesn’t have much time to go out and buy ingredients so she has to work with what she has at home
        <br>
        <b>Second step:</b>
        <br>
           She will need to add her ingredients into the pantry section
        <br>
        <b>Third step:</b>
        <br>
           After adding her ingredients, recipes will pop up that utilize the ingredients she already has at home. Given her busy schedule, she does not have time to add many recipes to her meal plan. She looks through the recipes page to find a meal that is gluten free but also quick to make
        <br><br>
        <b>Results</b>
        <br>
        At this point, the user will know what to do next. Either the user will add ingredients to her shopping list for future meals and also add meals to her meal plan for future use. In this scenario though, Itzel does not have much time and only wanted to make a quick meal.

        <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough of Mike Johnson</h3>
        Mike is a busy professional who wants to eat healthier and save time by meal prepping. He's looking for an app that can help him plan his meals for the week, generate shopping lists, and provide easy-to-follow recipes.<br>
        When Mike opens the app, he navigates to the meal planning section. He selects the upcoming week and starts adding recipes to each day's meal. He appreciates the app's suggestion feature, which recommends recipes based on his dietary preferences and available ingredients. After finalizing his meal plan, Mike proceeds to the shopping list section where all the necessary ingredients are automatically added. He reviews the list, makes a few adjustments, and then heads to the grocery store. With the app's help, Mike successfully completes his shopping and is ready to tackle meal prep for the week ahead.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
