# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

During our research, we conducted cross-team communication, we allowed other teams to review our wireframes and documents of each character. Based on this research we were able to examine three types of scenarios from our listening character. This allows our wireframe design to be tested and identify any software errors or bugs.
## Findings

After our cross-team communications were done, We collected multiple types of data from the wireframe design to users' experiences. Our first issue was two bugs. (“Bugs is a term for ongoing issues within the software or applications”). These issues were that users weren’t able to add ingredients to the pantry and save recipes to the applications. 

Our second finding was that users wanted us to add a “Quick Meal” section where the application would suggest quick and easy meals to prepare for busy users. Another finding that we were not aware of was the navigation system in place for the application. Some users were confused about how to navigate through the menus. To fix this we are going to redesign the navigation system. Besides this, the cross-team communication methods also help us gain some user experience.


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
